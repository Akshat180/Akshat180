## Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹
I am Akshat Rajawat, a B.Tech Computer Science grad. With a solid foundation in data analysis and predictive modeling, I have completed two internships where I successfully developed models to drive actionable business insights.

My passion for machine learning and AI drives me to continuously expand my knowledge and skills. I actively engage in projects on Kaggle and am currently advancing my expertise through courses from Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

What excites me most about AI and machine learning is their immense potential to solve complex problems and enhance various aspects of our lives. From healthcare to finance, these technologies have the power to revolutionize industries, improve efficiency, and foster innovation. I am particularly fascinated by the real-world applications, such as predictive models for health issues, loan delinquency detection, and personalized content curation.

I am eager to connect with professionals and organizations that share my enthusiasm for AI and machine learning, and I look forward to contributing to impactful projects that make a positive difference.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some data analyzing and prediction model projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka From DeepLearning.AI and Coursera.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at akshatrajawat18@gmail.com.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on time forcasting models.
